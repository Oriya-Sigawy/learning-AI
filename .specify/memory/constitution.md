Sync Impact Report
==================
Version change: 2.0.0 → 2.1.0
Rationale: Amendment to align the constitution with CLAUDE.md (the operating manual).
Materially expands the Development Workflow (adds an explicit Tasks review, surfaces
per-artifact Security review at Requirements and Specification per Principle V, and
marks the TDD phases as per-task) and enriches the Mandatory Review Gate definitions
with their operational checklists. No principles added or removed → MINOR bump per the
versioning policy.

Modified sections:
  - Mandatory Review Gates (gate definitions expanded; wording unified with CLAUDE.md)
  - Development Workflow (Tasks review added; Requirements/Specification Security review
    made explicit; "(per task)" added to the TDD phases)
Added principles: N/A
Removed principles: N/A
Added sections: N/A
Removed sections: N/A

Templates requiring updates:
  - .specify/templates/plan-template.md ✅ aligned
  - .specify/templates/spec-template.md ✅ aligned
  - .specify/templates/tasks-template.md ✅ aligned
  - CLAUDE.md ✅ aligned (gate definitions unified; workflow operationalized)

Follow-up TODOs: None.

# learning-AI Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Requirements First

All work MUST originate from explicit requirements.

The project MUST NOT:

- Implement assumptions.
- Infer new features.
- Expand scope without approval.

If requirements are unclear, work MUST stop and seek clarification before proceeding.

**Rationale**: Acting on unstated assumptions produces scope creep and rework. Explicit
requirements are the only authorized source of work.

### II. Specification-Driven Development

Every change MUST flow through the authorized workflow (see Development Workflow). Implementation
is NOT allowed until the planning artifacts for that workflow exist and have been reviewed.

- Production code MUST NOT be written before reviewed planning artifacts exist.
- Implementation MUST NEVER bypass the workflow.
- When implementation conflicts with requirements, specifications, or plans, the planning
  documents are the source of truth.

**Rationale**: A single authoritative pipeline keeps the project coherent, catches design
problems while they are cheap to fix, and ensures documented intent—not ad hoc code—governs the
system.

### III. Test Before Implementation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The project follows Test-Driven Development (TDD).

Rules:

- Tests MUST be written before implementation.
- Tests MUST be derived from requirements and `plan.md`.
- Tests MUST validate behavior, not implementation details.
- New functionality MUST have tests, observed failing, before implementation begins.

**Rationale**: Writing tests first forces clear behavioral contracts and prevents code that is
untestable or untested from entering the project.

### IV. Simplicity Over Complexity

The simplest solution that satisfies the requirements MUST be preferred.

The project MUST avoid:

- Overengineering.
- Unnecessary abstractions.
- Premature optimization.
- Speculative design.

Complexity MUST be justified before it is introduced.

**Rationale**: As a small single-developer learning project, accidental complexity is the
primary risk to progress and understanding.

### V. Security By Default

Security MUST be considered during requirements, planning, implementation, and review.

Security reviews MUST cover:

- `requirements.md`
- `spec.md`
- `plan.md`
- implementation code

Security MUST be designed into the solution rather than added afterward.

**Rationale**: Retrofitting security is costly and error-prone; designing for it from the start
keeps the solution sound.

### VI. Maintainability Over Cleverness

Code MUST be understandable by future maintainers.

The project MUST prefer:

- Readability.
- Consistency.
- Clear naming.
- Straightforward design.

The project MUST avoid:

- Clever but obscure solutions.
- Unnecessary complexity.
- Hidden behavior.

A future maintainer SHOULD be able to understand the project quickly.

**Rationale**: Code is read far more often than it is written; clarity outlasts cleverness.

## Mandatory Review Gates

Every change MUST be reviewed against the following areas before it is considered complete. A
change MUST NOT be merged or accepted until each gate has been reviewed:

- **Security** — trust boundaries, input validation, authentication, authorization, secrets,
  sensitive data, and OWASP risks (see Principle V).
- **Testing** — coverage and TDD compliance; tests derive from `plan.md`; edge cases, error
  handling, return values, and test independence (see Principle III).
- **Architecture** — alignment with the approved plan and simplicity (Principle IV); separation
  of concerns, maintainability, and no needless abstraction.
- **Performance** — acceptable resource and runtime behavior; bottlenecks, expensive operations,
  large datasets, and caching.
- **Logging** — adequate, useful, consistent, non-sensitive logging that supports debugging and
  observability.

## Development Workflow

The authorized end-to-end workflow is:

Requirements → Specification → Plan → Review → Tasks → Review → (per task) Tests → Verify
Expected Failure → Implementation → Verify Tests Pass → Mandatory Review Gates

Reviews fire as follows:

- **Requirements** and **Specification** — Security review (Principle V).
- **Plan** — Security, Performance, and Architecture review; planning artifacts MUST be approved
  before any code is written.
- **Tasks** — all five gates: every task testable with a corresponding test task, security- and
  performance-sensitive work captured as explicit tasks, logging included in the relevant tasks,
  and a simple breakdown.
- **Mandatory Review Gates** — all five gates re-applied to the implementation before the change
  is closed.

Rules:

- No phase may be skipped.
- Tests MUST be observed failing before implementation begins.
- All Mandatory Review Gates MUST be satisfied before a change is closed.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices in the project. When any document, habit, or
tool conflicts with it, this constitution prevails.

- **Amendments**: Changes to this constitution MUST be documented, justified, and dated. Each
  amendment increments the version per the policy below.
- **Versioning policy** (semantic versioning):
  - **MAJOR**: Backward-incompatible governance or principle removals/redefinitions.
  - **MINOR**: A new principle or section is added, or guidance is materially expanded.
  - **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording, or non-semantic refinements.
- **Compliance review**: All work MUST be verified against these principles and the Mandatory
  Review Gates. Any complexity that deviates from Principle IV MUST be explicitly justified.
